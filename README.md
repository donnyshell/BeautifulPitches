# BeautifulPitches
This is a project to beautify pitch descriptions on mulitpich climbs on mountainproject
Currently it is a firefox extension in development, the current goal for this project is to publish both a firefox and chrome version

### Current Features:
-- makes a pretty table

### What it will do in the future
-- Replace the pitch description
-- Have a revert button in case the above feature breaks the site
-- Maybe pulls out extra info like pitch length and grade?


Hopefully someone will find this useful
